# Interactive-Pumpkin
Interactive Pumpkin Project from Fall 2023
This interactive pumpkin took advantage of capacitive touch to create a fun, halloween themed game. The goal was to retreive candy from inside of the pumkin without triggering the goblin guards! If the player did, an LED strip would change colors, signalling the user that they lost!
